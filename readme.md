About This Project
===================

This is a very simple template for a Python project that uses separate
directory structures for the application source code and a set of tests
to be run using the pytest package. The template includes a simple python
script to invoke the tests.

Assumptions
------------

It is assumed that you are working on a system that already has Python 3 installed. The template has been designed to work on both Windows and Linux, but has been tested on Linux only.

It is assumed that you already have some version of the git SCM tool installed on your system.

Setup
-------

To create a Python 3 project based on this template, carry out the following
steps:

1. Install python if it isn't already available on your system, using the
instructions available at [python.org](http://python.org).
1. Install the VirtualEnv tool, which allows you to set up modules and dependencies without affecting the system Python installation. To do this type:```pip install virtualenv``` at the system command line. You may need administrative privileges to do this.
1. At the command line, change to the directory that you want your project to sit below, then create a virtual environment by typing: ```virtualenv <PROJECT NAME>``` (where <PROJECT NAME> is the name you want to give your project). A new directory should be created containing various directories and files that are used to support the Python virtual environment.
1. Log into GitHub and fork this project, giving it a new name such as "MyProject". Once you have done this, you can clone your new project from GitHub into the virtual directory you have created.
